<p>
  In the spirit of <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/">Google Guava</a>,
  Cava is a set of libraries and other tools to aid development of blockchain and
  other decentralized software in Java and other JVM languages.
</p>
<p>
  It includes a low-level bytes library, serialization and deserialization codecs
(e.g. <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP">RLP</a>), various cryptography
 functions and primatives, and lots of other helpful utilities.
</p>
<p>
  Cava is developed for JDK 1.8 or higher, and depends on various other FOSS libraries, including Guava.
